What it is:

This program is a simulates a Genetic Algorithm.
It has 4 classes:
RandomGenerator
FitnessFunction
Chromosome
GA
All the classes work together to create random genes and chromosomes.
The chromosomes are then run through the genetic algorithmm to create the fittest chromosomes.

How it works:

RandomGenerator is responsible for creating a random gene.
FitnessFunction calculates how fit the chromosome is.
Chromosome create the chromosome object and has all the members and functions.
GA is the main class which runs the program.

NOTE:

To use the program create the GA object add parameters and call the run function.
